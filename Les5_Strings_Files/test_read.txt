To pretty-print a string, we wish to center it on a line. We
do so by appending spaces to the left and the right of the string (in this way,
filling the line). When the string is too long, we shorten it and indicate this by
ending the string in . Write a function that performs this action, given
the following parameters: the length of the line m, the maximum length of the
string n (if a string has length larger than n, then only the first nâˆ’3 characters
of the string are kept together with ), and the string to pretty-print.
